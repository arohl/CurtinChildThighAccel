### Notebooks for the paper "Comparison of Deep Learning, Traditional Machine Learning, and Decision Tree Models for Activity Recognition in Children from Thigh-Worn Accelerometer Data" submitted to The Journal for the Measurement of Physical Behaviour

There are two directories
* *machine_learning* for the traditional ML models
* *deep_learning* for the Long Short-Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Networks models

The final models reported in the paper are saved in the appropriate sub directories. To use the traditional ML models on your own data, ensure the correct dependencies are used by using *pip install -r requirements.txt* with *python 3.10.13*. For the deep learning models, the conda *environment.yml* file is provided.
